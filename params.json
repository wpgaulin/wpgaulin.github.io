  "body": "## About Me\r\nThis is my first website that I have made so work with me here. This was very difficult for me to do because I am not a CSE major and this took a lot of time and effort. I am currently a freshman at the University at Buffalo, in the Accounting major. I am enjoying my time here so far and I hope to continue to do so.\r\n\r\n### About My Family\r\nI have grown up in a very large family with a lot of relatives. I am the second oldest of seven and there are three boys and four girls in my family. We have a dog which is a beagle named molly. My Dad also had a very large family, he was the youngest of eight, which is where we get a lot of our relatives from.\r\n\r\n### My Accomplishments\r\nI have been involved in many different sports and activities, since I was a little kid. Some of my great accomplishments have been in the academic world though. I have been on the honor role all four years at my High School which was very hard to do. I graduated my High School with an advanced regents diploma which was something that helped me get into the University at Buffalo.\r\n\r\n### My Hobbies\r\nI believe it is great to have a lot of hobbies so that I can stay active and involved all year round. My favorite thing to do in the winter is to snowboard. I got into snowboarding a couple of years ago and I just love it. It is so nice to just get away and enjoy the snow and the people around you at that very moment. In the summer I love fishing. Fishing is something that is so relaxing and easy to do. All it takes is a rod, some line, and a little bait.\r\n\r\n### CSE 199\r\nCSE 199 was a very difficult class for me considering I had no prior knowledge of any of this before. It was interesting to see what I could do in such a short amount of time. I really didn't ever know anything was created on the internet. Now I have a good base of knowledge of how the internet works!\r\n",
